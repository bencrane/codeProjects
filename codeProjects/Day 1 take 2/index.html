	<article>
		<p>This is my Day 1 Code Project. I decided to create a homepage listing out some information about myself, and including some relevant links. One thing I struggled with was getting the background picture to look good. I also was not able to figure out how to use an img tag in the HTML or to link to an image in the img folder in my Project. Another thing I tried to do is make the 'Here are some links about me' paragraph bold, without affecting the list elements...I was able to hack it by making a div for the links and then setting that id to normal, overriding the bold. I'm also not exactly sure what I'm doing with the article tag...as in, how I'm accessing it from the CSS.</p>
